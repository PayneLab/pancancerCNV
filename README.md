# pancancerCNV

This repository explores the effects of CNV/CNA (copy number variation/alteration) events in cancer datasets from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). To view analysis, see the Python notebooks in the `chr08/` directory. Other chromosomes coming soon.

### `cnvutils` sub-package

We include a utility package called `cnvutils` that contains all the detailed code used in each step of the analysis. To use the tool, it must be installed using `pip` on the machine that is running the code. Here are the installation instructions:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the same directory that this README is stored in.
3. Run the command `pip install cnvutils/`. This will find the package setup information in the `cnvutils/` directory, and install the package in your currently active Python environment.
4. To access the package, simply add `import cnvutils` to your Python code.
