# pancancerCNV

This repository explores the effects of CNV/CNA (copy number variation/alteration) events in cancer datasets from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC).

## `utils` sub-package

We include a small utility package that simplifies the code for these analysis by providing several commonly used functions for the project. To use the tool, it must be installed using `pip` on the machine that is running the code. Here are the installation instructions:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the same directory that this README is stored in.
3. Run the command `pip install utils_pkg/`. This will follow the last argument, which is a relative path to the package setup information, and install the package in your currently active Python environment.
4. To access the package, simply add `import utils` to your Python code.
